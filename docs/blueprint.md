## Style Guidelines:

- Use the primary color defined by the TweakCN nature theme.
- Use the background color defined by the TweakCN nature theme.
- Use the accent color defined by the TweakCN nature theme for interactive elements and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Montserrat' for a modern and readable interface, as defined in the TweakCN nature theme.
- Use simple, clear icons from a standard library (e.g., Material Icons) to represent actions like edit, delete, and complete.
- Use a clean, single-column layout for task lists on mobile, with a card-based design for each task.
- Use subtle transitions when tasks are created, updated, or deleted to provide visual feedback.
- All text must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).
- Focus on essential features and remove every element that isn't absolutely necessary. A good design has as little "design" as possible.
- Guide the user's eye by emphasizing the most important elements with contrast, size, and weight.
- Group related items together (Proximity) and align elements along invisible lines (Alignment).
- Embrace ample whitespace to frame content, improve focus, and give the design room to breathe.
- Use one single sans-serif typeface for the interface to ensure legibility.
- Use a predefined and consistent type scale (e.g., 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 20px, 24px).
- Body text should be 16px-18px with a line-height of at least 1.5.
- Use only regular (400-500) and bold (600-700) weights.
